# Contributing to Awesome-SaaS ðŸš€

Thanks for wanting to contribute! This repo is a curated collection of templates/projects built using the Alchemyst AI Platform - focused on AI Agents, AI SaaS, Agentic AI, Memory AI, etc.

## ðŸ“Œ How to Contribute

You donâ€™t need to fork this repo unless you want to modify the docs itself. Just do the following for your own repo:

1. Make your repository **public** and ensure it's relevant.  
2. **Add the topic/tag** `alchemyst-awesome-saas` and other relevant tags to your repository.   
3. Wait - Awesome-SaaS has an automatic/daily refresh (early morning) that picks up repos with the `alchemyst-awesome-saas` topic and adds them to the listing.  

---

## âœ… Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your repo actually aligns with the themes (templates, agents, memory, etc.).  
- Use a descriptive README in your repo so people know what it does.  
- Keep tags clean and relevant. Too many irrelevant topics dilute discoverability.  
- Make sure your repo doesnâ€™t violate licensing or content rules.

## ðŸ›  Troubleshooting

If your repo doesnâ€™t show up:

- âœ… Repo is public  
- âœ… You added the `alchemyst-awesome-saas` topic  
- âœ… Wait until the next automatic refresh
- âœ… If still missing, [**raise an issue**](https://github.com/Alchemyst-ai/awesome-saas/issues/new)
