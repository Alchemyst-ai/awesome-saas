3. Inside the `agents/` folder, **create a new folder** with a descriptive name for your agent.  
4. Add:
   - Your **agent code**  
   - A **README.md** explaining what it does, how to run it, and any dependencies

Thatâ€™s it! Once reviewed, your contribution will be merged and showcased.

## âœ… Contribution Guidelines

- Ensure your agent actually aligns with the themes (templates, agents, memory, etc.).  
- Use a descriptive README inside your agent folder so people know what it does.  
- Keep your implementation clean and organized (no unnecessary files).  
- Make sure your repo doesnâ€™t violate licensing or content rules.
