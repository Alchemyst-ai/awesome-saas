### If Issues Found Post-Deployment

1. Immediately rollback to previous version
2. Investigate issue in staging environment
3. Apply fix and re-deploy
4. Monitor for 24 hours post-fix

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures

```bash
# Clear Next.js cache
rm -rf .next

# Clear node_modules and reinstall
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Check for TypeScript errors
npx tsc --noEmit
```

#### Environment Variable Issues

```bash
# Verify environment variables locally
node -e "console.log(process.env.ALCHEMYST_API_KEY)"

# Test API connection
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ALCHEMYST_API_KEY" \
     https://api.getalchemystai.com/health
```

#### Performance Issues

```bash
# Analyze bundle
npm run analyze

# Check for memory leaks
npm run test -- --detectOpenHandles

# Monitor performance
npm run performance:monitor
```
